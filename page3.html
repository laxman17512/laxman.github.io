  <p class="justified-text">A wiki is a collaborative site where users can add, edit or remove content.

    From fansites to encyclopedias, wikis are one of the most popular ways to read, write, and share information online. As community-driven projects, wikis thrive thanks to grassroots networks of people that run them.
    
    When we started Slite in 2016 as a notes app for teams, we didn't know that we'd become fanatical about wikis. As our team grew from a single home base in Paris, to a constellation of offices around the world, we realized that we needed to share more than notes. We needed a home base for gathering, organizing, and distributing team knowledge. Now, our Slite contains ideas, projects, discussions, sketches, guidebooks, and glossaries. It's basically our collective brain.
